# Blind Refusal — minisite

A static, single-paper "minisite" for **_Blind Refusal: Language Models Refuse
to Help Users Evade Unjust, Absurd, and Illegitimate Rules_** (Cameron Pattison,
Lorenzo Manuali, Seth Lazar), built by the [MINT Lab](https://www.mintresearch.org).

The site renders the paper as a readable web page (sections, figures, tables,
references) from content extracted directly out of the paper's arXiv source, with
machine-stamped provenance so a reader can see exactly which version of the source
the page was built from and when.

Source of record: [arXiv:2604.06233](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.06233).

## Auto-sync from source

**This site keeps itself up to date with arXiv automatically.**

A scheduled GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/sync-from-source.yml`) runs **once a
day**. It downloads the current arXiv artifacts, regenerates the page, and — only
if the source actually changed — commits the update. On a normal day it finds the
source unchanged and does nothing.

The whole thing is gated by one conspicuous flag in `paper.config.json`, sitting
right under the `source` block:

```json
"autoSyncFromSource": true,
```

| `autoSyncFromSource` | Behaviour |
|:---|:---|
| `true` (default) | arXiv is the source of truth. The daily workflow checks arXiv and updates the site whenever the source changes. |
| `false` | **Auto-sync is off.** The daily workflow does nothing. Set this when the arXiv version is out of date, or when you want a **different source of truth** (a newer local draft, a private manuscript, `source.kind: "private"`, etc.). While it is `false`, nothing touches the committed content — you regenerate the site by hand (below). |

Set it to `false` the moment arXiv stops being authoritative for this paper. That
is the one switch that decides whether the robot or a human owns the content.

> Every minisite built from this template carries this same flag and this same
> section. If you are looking at a sibling site and wondering whether it
> auto-updates, check `autoSyncFromSource` in its `paper.config.json`.

### Manual regeneration (when `autoSyncFromSource` is `false`, or any time)

The extractor reads whatever is in `paper-assets/` — it does not go to the
network. To rebuild from a source of your choosing:

1. Put the source in `paper-assets/` matching the paths declared in
   `paper.config.json` → `inputs`:
   - `inputs.pdf` (default `paper-assets/2604.06233v1.pdf`)
   - `inputs.latexDir` (default `paper-assets/latex from arxiv/`, containing
     `main.tex`, `main.bbl`, figure assets, etc.)
2. Regenerate:
   ```bash
   pip install pypdf pillow
   python3 scripts/extract_paper.py
   ```
   This rewrites `paper-content.js` (including `PAPER_META` with a fresh
   `sourceHash` and `retrievedAt`) and re-extracts `figure-1.png`.
3. If `figure-1.png` came out larger than the committed version, re-encode it
   optimized (Pillow, `optimize=True`) so you never commit an unoptimized figure —
   `scripts/sync_from_source.py` does this automatically; by hand it's a one-liner
   with Pillow.
4. Commit the regenerated `paper-content.js` (and any changed figures).

You can also run the full sync pipeline (download + extract + compare + optimize)
on any machine:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_from_source.py    # exit 0 = in sync, 10 = updated, >0 = error
```

It respects the `autoSyncFromSource` flag and `source.kind`, so with the flag
`false` it exits immediately without touching anything.

## Architecture

Everything the reader sees is driven by generated data, not hand-written HTML:

- **`paper.config.json`** — the hand-edited, per-paper metadata. Title, authors,
  the `source` declaration (`kind`/`label`/`url`/`id`), the `autoSyncFromSource`
  flag, input paths, and the figure/table/citation definitions. Nothing here is
  machine-overwritten except the `source.id` version string on an auto-sync
  update.
- **`paper-assets/`** — the raw source (arXiv PDF + LaTeX). **Git-ignored**, so CI
  always downloads it fresh; locally it holds your working copy of the source.
- **`scripts/extract_paper.py`** — reads the config + assets and generates
  `paper-content.js`. Alongside the content it emits `window.PAPER_META`:

  ```js
  window.PAPER_META = {
    source: { kind, label, url },       // url omitted when kind == "private"
    retrievedAt: "2026-07-13T01:45:00Z", // when extraction ran (UTC)
    sourceHash: "9656aea8117c"           // 12-hex SHA-256 over the source inputs
  };
  ```

  `sourceHash` is a truncated SHA-256 over every file under `inputs.latexDir` plus
  the PDF (sorted relative path + content). It identifies the exact source version
  publicly without revealing anything about a private source, and it drives **drift
  detection**: the extractor reports whether the hash is unchanged or changed vs
  the previous `PAPER_META`. That comparison is what the auto-sync workflow uses to
  decide "in sync" vs "update".
- **`scripts/sync_from_source.py`** — the substance behind the workflow:
  check-flag → download → extract → compare → optimize figures → update version id.
  Distinct exit codes (`0`/`10`/`>0`) let the thin workflow decide whether to
  commit.
- **`index.html` / `script.js` / `styles.css`** — the static shell. `script.js`
  reads the generated globals and renders the page, including the **Source** block
  in the About section (built from `PAPER_META`, with a local-timezone
  "last updated" date).

### Sidebar navigation

The primary sidebar follows the information hierarchy on `mintresearch.org` while
remaining self-contained in this repository. The **Microsites** group stays open,
**Blind Refusal** is its active leaf, and the leaf expands into the anchors for
this page. Appendix sections and About are page anchors rather than separate
top-level pages. Keep the peer-microsite labels and URLs synchronized with
`mintresearch.org/src/data/navigation.ts`; do not couple this site to the main
site's runtime styles or scripts.

Typography follows the same division of labour as the other microsites:
JetBrains Mono is reserved for navigation, headings, labels, legends, metadata,
and data tables; Newsreader is used for sustained paper prose and references.

Build order: edit `paper.config.json` and/or `paper-assets/` → run
`extract_paper.py` → open `index.html`.

## Local preview

No build server needed — it's a static site. Serve the directory and open it:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

(Opening `index.html` via `file://` mostly works, but a local HTTP server avoids
browser restrictions on loading the generated `paper-content.js`.)

## Template note

This README, the `autoSyncFromSource` flag, and the `sync-from-source.yml`
workflow are part of the **minisite template**: every per-paper minisite carries
its own `paper.config.json` + `paper-assets/`, the shared extractor, and this same
daily auto-sync automation. When cloning this into a new minisite, keep this README
section on auto-sync intact and set the flag according to whether arXiv (or another
declared source) is authoritative for that paper.
